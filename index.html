        <h2>About Trivikram</h2>
        <p>A university gold medalist with a master's degree in Nuclear physics, Trivikram initially had no plans to enter the entertainment industry, but his interest in film and Telugu literature led him to become a screenwriter, and later a film director. He is known among the Telugu audience by the epithets "Maatala Maantrikudu" (transl.â€‰Wizard of Words), and "Guruji". His film craft is identified by its creative and quick-witted dialogue, humorous content, fast-paced repartee mixed with action, mythological references, courtship drama, importance of women in this world, and issues in relationships.Some of his films are noted for integrating ideas from Hindu philosophy into mainstream popular cinema.

In 2000, he wrote the dialogues for Nuvve Kavali, which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu. His Telugu directorial debut film Nuvve Nuvve (2002) won the Nandi Award for Best Feature Film (Silver). His other writing and directorial works include films such as Swayamvaram (1999), Chiru Navvutho (2000), Nuvvu Naaku Nachav (2001), Manmadhudu (2002), Malliswari (2004), Jai Chiranjeeva (2005), Athadu (2005), Jalsa (2008), Khaleja (2010), Julayi (2012), Attarintiki Daredi (2013), S/O Satyamurthy (2015), A Aa (2016), Agnyaathavaasi (2018), Aravinda Sametha Veera Raghava (2018), Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo (2020) and Guntoor karam(2024).</p>
